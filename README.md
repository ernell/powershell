# repo: powershell
This repo is simply a collection of scripts that I find useful.

Please feel free to contribute! No strings attached....

# style
- Every script should be placed in a separate folder in a matching category
- Folder has a descriptive name.
- Folder has a README.md describing use of the script.
- Code is nice and tidy, readable to every human being

Happy coding!!!
